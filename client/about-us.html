        <h3>INTRODUCING THE YUJ CLUB</h3>
        <p>You All are stepping into a new stage of life. It is going to be a new journey ahead. Some of you might have unwillingly landed up in the college, some of you might have willingly come here. Some things are of course in your hand and some situations are such that you have to go with the flow. Even in the coming phase of your life there are going to be many more challenges, competition, ups and downs, the only way to sustain them and being satisfied by striving for better is when you unleash your true potential. The only constant thing that helps is you, yourself, your mindset and your attitude towards your health. I guess the pandemic situation was by itself quite alarming and made people little more conscious towrads health, but still adding to it do not wait for any disease or disorder hit you and make you release your responsibiltiy towards your health. Do not take your body for granted. In the long run it is the only thing that is going to accompany you. Stepping into hostle life is like by-default you are going to develop habits of staying up late, eating junk, no sleep schedules and you dont release how much granted you take your body. If not before, now is the time you start with some healthy practices for your body, including yoga in your schedules. As there is a technology to create external wellbeing, there is a whole dimension of science and technology to create inner wellbeing and it starts with yoga. The college has introduced a yoga club this year to help students prioritize their first and foremest component of life ie- health. All the interesting activities of the club will be discussed in the coming sessions ahead</p>
